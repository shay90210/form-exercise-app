# Shannon Bentley's Form Exercise 

## An exercise form primarily developed using the framework React and other scalable UI libraries.

### Form Exercise Goals 
- Display a form with inputs for each field outlined in the instructions
- Allow a user to complete and submit the form
- Do not allow form submission without completing the entire form
- Provide feedback upon successful form submission

### Creating the State and Occupation Options 
To create the state and occupation options, I had to be strategic with knowing how to use the 'select' type. 

- Copied a list of already created state select code from FreeFormMatter USA HTML Select List (I use this website for personal projects when creating state select options with a dropdown menu)
