# Shannon Bentley's Form Exercise 

## An exercise form primarily developed using the framework React and other scalable UI libraries.

### Project Navigation 
- FormExercise.js is located in components folder

### Form Exercise Goals 
- Display a form with inputs for each field outlined in the instructions
- Allow a user to complete and submit the form
- Do not allow form submission without completing the entire form
- Provide feedback upon successful form submission

### Creating the Form 
To create the entire form, I had to be strategic with knowing which form worked best for the POST request and meeting the needs of my code.
- Swapped between FORMIK and REACT FORMS (was undecided due to the lack of documentation for FORMIK to understand how to connect the POST and GET method to the code)
- Utilized the fetch API method without creating a server because it is only a form component being used 
- The fetch method was the best option because the endpoint is single url - https://frontend-take-home.fetchrewards.com/form
- Copied a list of already created state select code from FreeFormMatter USA HTML Select List (I use this website for personal projects when creating state select options with a dropdown menu)

### Assignment Successes
- Getting the form to render on the page
- The functionality of interacting with the form
- The password hides for security purposes
- Select dropdowns appears on one option when chosen
- The form was sent to the console.log to show successful submission

### Transitions of Project via Images
